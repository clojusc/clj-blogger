*A Clojure library for the Google Blogger REST API*

## About

This is a simple REST (HTTP) client for Google's Blogger service. This library
was written against the following release of Blogger:
 * https://developers.google.com/blogger/docs/3.0/reference/


## Before Use

There are a few things to be aware of before deciding to use this library:

* Google Authentication
* Configuration
* Alpha Status

### Google Authentication

Because this library utilizes protected Google resources, you will need to
[set up OAuth2 access with Google][oauth2-setup]; note that this library only
supports using service accounts (thus avoiding the need to introduce a web
browser into the mix).

Once created, there will be an option to download your OAuth2 credential data
in JSON format -- do so. Save this to a file (e.g.,
`~/.google/blog-publisher-oauth2-creds.json`); you will use it when creating a
client (see below). This file will look something like this:

```json
{
  "type": "service_account",
  "project_id": "blog-id-you-created",
  "private_key_id": "123abc...",
  "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY----- ... ",
  "client_email": "google-blog-updates@blog-id-you-created.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
  "client_id": "12345...",
  "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
  "token_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token",
  "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
  "client_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/google-blog-updates%40blog-id-you-created.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
}
```


### Configuration

Instead of remembering to enter your Google blog ID every time you want to
publish content, you can create a JSON configuration file that contains an
associative array with the key `blog-id` and associated value that is the
blog ID of the blog with which you want to work.

Note that if you will be repeatedly operating on Blogger resources with the
same `user-id`, `page-id`, or `post-id`, you may make those entries in the
config file as well, and they will be used on all appropriate requests.

You can save this to a file like `~/.google/blog.json` and use it when
creating a client (see below). This file will look something like this:

```json
{"blog-id": "12345"}
```


### Alpha Status

This is a brand-new library. I'm using it to publish updates to several of my
own blogs. As such, I've started with the API calls that I need the most.
Your mileage may vary. That being said, if there's something you'd like to
see added, feel free to open a ticket or even submit a pull request :-)

#### Supported API Calls

Here are the API functions that have been implemented:

* `get-blog`
* `get-pageviews`
* `get-posts`


#### Supported Utility functions

Processing previously exported Blogger XML data with
`clojusc.blogger.xml.parser.export`:

* `print-entry-ids` - display the ids for all exported data with the `<entry>` XML tag (posts, comments, layout, the blog itself, etc.)
* `print-post-ids` - display just the ids for the `<entry>` elements whose ids match the Blogger post id format
* `get-post-ids` - same as above, but returns a lazy sequence of post ids instead of printing them
* `get-entry` - given 1) XML data that has been processed by `clojure.zip/xml-zip` and 2) a Blogger `<entry>` id, get the entry and all it's child XML nodes; returns a parsed collection that may be used by any of the `extract-*` utility functions
* `get-posts` - given XML data that has been processed by `clojure.zip/xml-zip`, returns a lazy sequence of parsed XML entries of blog posts
* `extract-xml-text`, `extract-attrs`, `extract-draft-bool`, `extract-author`, `extract-tags`, `extract-url`, `extract-post` - given a parsed collection (e.g., as returned by `get-entry`) and potentially additional parameters, extract the desired data. In the cases of `extract-author` and `extract-post`, a hash-map is returned that represents the node's children; all others return just the data itself.
* `extract-posts` - given XML data that has been processed by `clojure.zip/xml-zip`, return a lazy sequence of blog post hash-map data

For example usage, see the unit tests in the `clojusc.blogger.test.xml.parser.export`
namespace.


#### Unsupported API Calls

These are the ones remaining:

* `get-blogs`
* `get-comment`
* `get-comments`
* `approve-comment`
* `delete-comment`
* `spam-comment` (rename to `hide-spam-comment`?)
* `remove-comment-content`
* `get-page`
* `get-pages`
* `add-page`
* `delete-page`
* `update-page`
* `get-post`
* `search`
* `add-post`
* `delete-post`
* `update-post`
* `publish-post`
* `unpublish-post`
* `get-user`
* `get-user-blog`
* `get-user-post`
* `get-user-posts`


## Layout

Note that the code layout for this project does not match the Blogger REST API
URLs. However, since none of the function names collide, a flat namespace is
provided for all API calls: `clojusc.blogger.api`. The implementations for the
protocol defined there are provided in sensible library namespaces under
`clojusc.blogger.api.impl.*`.


## Client

This is essentially a very thin wrapper around
[clj-http](https://github.com/dakrone/clj-http): we don't do anything clever on
top of it. Anything you'd normally pass to clj-http functions will work the
same with clj-blogger (in most cases, this will be the third argument to the
functions in this API).


## Documentation

Versioned Clojure client documentation is available here:

* [API Reference][api-docs]
* [Marginalia][margin-docs]


## Usage

From the above notes (and a quick look at the source code), it should be fairly
clear how to use the API. First, create a client:

```clj
(requre '[clojusc.blogger.api.core :as api])

(def c (api/create-client {:creds-file "blog-publisher-oauth2-creds.json"
                           :config-file "blog.json"}))
```


```clj
(api/get-blog c {:blog-id "12345"})
```

You can also pass options to clj-http:

```clj
(api/get-blog c {:blog-id "12345"} {:debug true})
```


### Partial Responses

clj-blogger supports asking the API for just a subset of the response data.
Simply pass the `:fields` option (per the [API partial response spec][part-resp])
For instance, if you'd only like to see the titles of all posts:

```clj
(api/get-posts c {:fields ["items(title)"]})
```
